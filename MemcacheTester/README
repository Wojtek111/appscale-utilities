To use this tool, edit the Memcached servers your client is connecting to in the MemcacheTester.java file. 

To compile, run "javac -cp spymemcached-2.8.4.jar MemcacheTester.java"

To run, the first command line argument is the key/value you are putting. The second argument is "put" or "get". The third optional argument is to specify one specific server you want to put or get to/from.
An example of running this is "java -classpath :spymemcached-2.8.4.jar MemcacheTester test1 get 127.0.0.1"

The tool will print if the put is successful or not and will print what the return value for a get is.
